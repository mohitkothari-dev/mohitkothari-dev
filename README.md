# 👋 Hey, I'm Mohit Kothari

I have designed, developed, deployed and managed a full-stack Blog application with its dedicated CMS from scratch using the LAMP stack. Also, did blog writing and generated over 750 monthly readers traffic both via social media (LinkedIn posts, Quora articles) and organically, that too in the pre-ChatGPT era. Super Proud 🦚.
