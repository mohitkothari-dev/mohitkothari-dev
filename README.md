### 🚀 My proudest achievement

I've **designed, developed, deployed and managed a full-stack Blog application with its dedicated CMS** from scratch using the LAMP stack. Not just that, I also wrote blogs and generated **over 750 monthly readers** through social media (LinkedIn posts, Quora articles) and organic traffic. **Super Proud.**

**The best part?** This was in the **pre-ChatGPT era**. The era when StackOverflow used to be the go-to platform for developers.  It was live for 2 years from 2018 - 2020, and this product helped me to land my first job as a teacher at my own college, where I taught C++ and ASP.NET. 

Now I have both perspectives: building from the ground up traditionally, and also working with AI-assisted coding. I've seen both sides of the evolution.


### 🎮 That one cool project

**Teachable Game:** A 3D game played with human poses, harnessing PoseNet magic for interactive, futuristic fun!
This came from pure curiosity during my master's final year. The idea popped up: *"What if we had a game that could be innovatively played without any hardware controllers, using just web cameras, where human poses define the character's movement?"*
After many trials and errors, I successfully built it. It even won a prize at an inter-college project exhibition. **Small achievement**, but a **big motivation.** Proof that I could build something unique that I thought of.
